# amazon-review-nlp
Using Amazon review data to map the relationship between customer sentiment and product ratings. I explore multiple vectorization techniques such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF and N-grams. Then I perform hyperparameter tuning on multiple classification models such as Logistic regression, Random Forest Classifiers and Support Vector Machines and finally achieve a recall of 0.86.
